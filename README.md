# Stick Hero

## Bonus Implementation - Invisible Stick
The idea of our bonus came was inspired from a mistake where the stick would be invisible for a while and then suddenly appear when the stick the input finished. We realized that it would be a fun game to just guess how big the stick is based on the time rather than a visual indication.
